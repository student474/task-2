<h1 style="color:red;">govenment engineering college</h1>
<p style="color:blue">Everyone prepares for JEE MAIN & ADVANCE having dreams of getting IITs, NITs, GFTIs, IIITs etc.<br> Some students who are financially stable also think for top private institutions like BITS, VIT, etc.

See<br> every year, about 12,00,000 students test themselves for these prestigious institutes of India.<br> But, unfortunately, not everyone is going to get admission in these.

</p> <hr>
<p style="color:purple">some very basic requirements you should check in an institute before taking admission into it. <br>Don't ever go for name, fame of college just because it's a government college. <br>Believe me, some of these are even more worst than private institutions.
</p> <hr>
<p style="color:green">Also when our parents studied there were very few private colleges so best option for them was to get<br> government college that belief of government colleges being better than private is still prevalent in them
